# Model-Driven Development

Model-Driven Development (MDD) is a software development approach that 
focuses on creating domain models, which are conceptual models that 
describe the various aspects of a software application. 

In the context of Java programming, MDD involves using models as the 
primary artifacts in the software development process, rather than 
relying solely on source code.
